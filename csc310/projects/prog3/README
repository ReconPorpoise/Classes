Project 3: The B-Tree
---------------------
The goal of this project is to implement a B-Tree with the intention
of storing, sorting, and accessing song album data from our Album class.

To implement this, the file name must be taken in on the command line and be
made sure of its validity. Then, Album objects must be taken in from the given
file in the format of <UPC> <Artist> <Title> on their own lines.
